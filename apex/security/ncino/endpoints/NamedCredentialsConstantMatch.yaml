      Named Credentials (and callout endpoints) should be used instead of hard-coding credentials.
      1. Hard-coded credentials are hard to maintain when mixed in with application code.
      2. It is particularly hard to update hard-coded credentials when they are used amongst different classes.
      3. Granting a developer access to the codebase means granting knowledge of credentials, and thus keeping a two-level access is not possible.
      4. Using different credentials for different environments is troublesome and error-prone.
